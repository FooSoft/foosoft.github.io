into the action adventure genre, and follows the storyline of the Disney movie. In addition to the main single-player
campaign, this title features a co-op multi-player mode and three mini-games: <em>Walk the Plank</em>, <em>Shoot the Monkey</em>, and
<em>Boom Barge</em>.<ul><li>Implementing all of the game’s world objects: pickups, breakables, obstacles, and puzzle elements.<li>Adding bone-based paper-dolling support (i.e. having Jack Sparrow wear a hat and wield a sword).<li>Programming the three of the mini-games included in the title (single and multi-player modes).<li>Designing and implementing the AI for several unconventional enemies and bosses.<li>Defining and implementing the studio’s first fixed rail camera system (which included various effects).<li>Implementing scripting support for most of the game’s features (triggers, object placement, event hooks).</ul><p><a href=/portfolio/amaze/img/potc-dmc.png class="img-thumbnail img-thumbnail-inline" data-title=Packaging data-toggle=lightbox data-gallery=gallery><img src=/portfolio/amaze/img/potc-dmc-thumb.png alt=Packaging></a><h2 id=pirates-of-the-caribbean-at-worlds-end>Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End</h2><p>Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End is a sequel to the previous PotC game I’ve worked on at Amaze Entertainment,
and follows the plot of the Disney movie. This game, while still action adventure, featured significantly more
platforming than its predecessor (hooking, sidling, rope swinging, climbing, etc., as well as two new minigames: <em>Liar’s
Dice</em> and <em>Dueling</em> (which made heavy use of the Nintendo DS touch screen). Although this title did not feature a co-op
mode, both of the minigames had multiplayer capability for local wireless play.<ul><li>Implementing the majority of world objects used in the game - pickups, breakables, obstacles and puzzle elements.<li>Programming various platforming mechanics such as ledge grab, sidle and climbing with respect to a level’s BSP data and scripting.<li>Architecting and implementing the <em>Touch Screen Dueling</em> mechanic, including custom boss AI behavior and multiplayer functionality.<li>Developing the enemy AI (behaviors and actions) for the game’s adventure mode, including waypointless pathfinding.<li>Implementation of the game’s multiplayer lobbies, player matching, and <em>download and play</em> functionality.<li>Design and programming of a versatile damage system for combat in the adventure mode.</ul><p><a href=/portfolio/amaze/img/potc-awe.png class="img-thumbnail img-thumbnail-inline" data-title=Packaging data-toggle=lightbox data-gallery=gallery><img src=/portfolio/amaze/img/potc-awe-thumb.png alt=Packaging></a><h2 id=studio-tools-and-support>Studio Tools and Support</h2><p>While working at <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaze_Entertainment>Amaze Entertainment</a>, I have contributed my effort
to the development of numerous in-house tools. The most significant of these was an application known internally as
<em>Quintessence</em> — a studio-wide level scripting tool that was utilized on virtually all 3d games made by Amaze.
Quintessence had many features but it was primarily used by designers to add enemies, world objects, triggers, spawn
points, camera paths, and countless other game-specific features to raw map geometry.<p>Quintessence was still in its infancy when I joined Amaze, and thus two of my coworkers and I were tasked to quickly get
it up and running with the features needed by designers. This tool was the first large-scale C# application I had worked
on up to that point, with the renderer being based on the Managed DirectX wrapper I’d written earlier as a university
student. As time went on, Quintessence evolved into a sophisticated tool for design, being adaptable both specific
project needs and personal preferences.<ul><li>Implementing large portions of the tool’s UI with .NET Windows Forms.<li>Adding Visual Source Safe integration to simplify user-end source control tasks.<li>Developing various DirectX world drawing and camera features to make Quintessence easier to use.<li>Working on command line support for managing and exporting intermediate map formats to raw ROM data.<li>Participating in requirement gathering and support roles with designers to improve the tool.</ul><p><a href=/portfolio/amaze/img/shrek.png class="img-thumbnail img-thumbnail-inline" data-title="Shrek Super Slam" data-toggle=lightbox data-gallery=gallery><img src=/portfolio/amaze/img/shrek-thumb.png alt="Shrek Super Slam"></a>
