<a href=http://www.bothell.washington.edu/CSS/>Computing Software Systems</a>, and have been actively <a href=https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,204633/>building my
career</a> as a software developer since 2005. In 2014,
I enrolled in the <a href=http://www.sfc.keio.ac.jp/en/gsmg/education/program/ci.html>Cyber Informatics</a> Master’s program at
<a href=http://www.sfc.keio.ac.jp/en/gsmg/>Keio University</a>, in Japan. Upon graduating in 2016, I returned to the United
States to continue my career as a game programmer.<p>You can select a link from the list below to read more about my experience or view my

2</a> MMORPG. Although my official role was that of an engine programmer, I made significant
contributions across the entire code base, designing, implementing, and optimizing key systems. I am particularly proud
of my improvements to the game patching system, which saved the company millions of dollars on net café data transaction
fees in China.<p>I returned to <a href=https://www.arena.net>ArenaNet</a> after completing my studies to contribute to a new and exciting
technology initiative. Given the title of <em>Programmer at Large</em>, I had the latitude and trust of my employer to work on
engine features that I identified as being important to the project. One of my overarching responsibilities became
rearchitecting an existing codebase to support very large streaming worlds, which have never been seen in the Guild Wars
franchise. This complex and far-reaching task gave me the opportunity to engineer multiple systems of which I am very
proud.<h2 id=amaze-entertainmentportfolioamaze-small2005----2007small><a href=/portfolio/amaze>Amaze Entertainment</a> <small>2005 – 2007</small></h2><p>While at <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaze_Entertainment>Amaze</a>, I worked on small teams of two to three programmers
to develop six <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS>Nintendo DS</a> titles including several well-known Disney
licenses. I communicated directly with designers and artists to build new game features and tools; the managed DirectX
based game I wrote in college became the foundation of a studio-wide map content editor.</div><script src=/lib/jquery.min.js></script><script src=/lib/tether/js/tether.min.js></script><script src=/lib/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script src=/lib/lightbox/ekko-lightbox.min.js></script><script src=/main.js></script><script>var clicky_site_ids = clicky_site_ids || []; clicky_site_ids.push(101024911);</script><script async src=//static.getclicky.com/js></script>
