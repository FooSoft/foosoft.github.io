Over the years, this extension has evolved to contain many
complex features, which have become increasingly difficult for me to test across different browsers, versions, and
environments. All new changes are initially introduced into the <em>testing</em> version, and when I am reasonably confident
that they are bug free, they will get promoted to the <em>stable</em> version. If you are technically savvy and don&#39;t mind
submitting issues on GitHub, try the <em>testing</em> version, otherwise the <em>stable</em> version will be your best bet.<ul><li><p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>

<a href=https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPWING>EPWING</a> format. They were often utilized in portable electronic dictionaries
similar to the ones pictured below. These dictionaries are often sought after by language learners for their correctness
and excellent coverage of the Japanese language.<p>Unfortunately, as most of the dictionaries released in this format are proprietary I am unable to bundle them with
Yomichan. You will need to procure these dictionaries yourself and import them with <a href=/projects/yomichan-import>Yomichan
Import</a>. Please see the project page for additional details.<p><a href=/projects/yomichan/img/epwing-devices.jpg class="img-thumbnail img-thumbnail-inline" data-title="Pocket EPWING dictionaries" data-toggle=lightbox data-gallery=gallery><img src=/projects/yomichan/img/epwing-devices-thumb.png alt="Pocket EPWING dictionaries"></a><h2 id=anki-integration>Anki Integration</h2><p>Yomichan features automatic flashcard creation for <a href=https://apps.ankiweb.net/>Anki</a>, a free application designed to help you
retain knowledge. This feature requires the prior installation of an Anki plugin called <a href=/projects/anki-connect>AnkiConnect</a>.
Please see the respective project page for more information about how to set up this software.<h3 id=flashcard-configuration>Flashcard Configuration</h3><p>Before flashcards can be automatically created, you must configure the templates used to create term and/or Kanji notes.
If you are unfamiliar with Anki deck and model management, this would be a good time to reference the <a href=https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html>Anki
Manual</a>. In short, you must specify what information should be included in the
flashcards that Yomichan creates through AnkiConnect.<p>Flashcard fields can be configured with the following steps:<ol><li><p>Open the Yomichan options page and scroll down to the section labeled <em>Anki Options</em>.<li><p>Tick the checkbox labeled <em>Enable Anki integration</em> (Anki must be running with <a href=/projects/anki-connect>AnkiConnect</a> installed).<li><p>Select the type of template to configure by clicking on either the <em>Terms</em> or <em>Kanji</em> tabs.<li><p>Select the Anki deck and model to use for new creating new flashcards of this type.<li><p>Fill the model fields with markers corresponding to the information you wish to include (several can be used at
once). Advanced users can also configure the actual <a href=https://handlebarsjs.com/>Handlebars</a> templates used to create
the flashcard contents (this is strictly optional).<h4 id=markers-for-term-cards>Markers for Term Cards</h4><table class=table><thead class=thead-light><tr><th>Marker<th>Description<tbody><tr><td><code>{audio}</code><td>Audio sample of a native speaker&#39;s pronunciation in MP3 format (if available).<tr><td><code>{cloze-body}</code><td>Raw, inflected term as it appeared before being reduced to dictionary form by Yomichan.<tr><td><code>{cloze-prefix}</code><td>Text for the containing <code>{sentence}</code> from the start up to the value of <code>{cloze-body}</code>.<tr><td><code>{cloze-suffix}</code><td>Text for the containing <code>{sentence}</code> from the value of <code>{cloze-body}</code> to the end.<tr><td><code>{dictionary}</code><td>Name of the dictionary from which the card is being created (unavailable in <em>grouped</em> mode).<tr><td><code>{expression}</code><td>Term expressed as Kanji (will be displayed in Kana if Kanji is not available).<tr><td><code>{furigana}</code><td>Term expressed as Kanji with Furigana displayed above it (e.g. <ruby>日本語<rt>にほんご</ruby>).<tr><td><code>{furigana-plain}</code><td>Term expressed as Kanji with Furigana displayed next to it in brackets (e.g. 日本語[にほんご]).<tr><td><code>{glossary}</code><td>List of definitions for the term (output format depends on whether running in <em>grouped</em> mode).<tr><td><code>{reading}</code><td>Kana reading for the term (empty for terms where the expression is the reading).<tr><td><code>{screenshot}</code><td>Screenshot of the web page taken at the time the term was added.<tr><td><code>{sentence}</code><td>Sentence, quote, or phrase in which the term appears in the source content.<tr><td><code>{tags}</code><td>Grammar and usage tags providing information about the term (unavailable in <em>grouped</em> mode).<tr><td><code>{url}</code><td>Address of the web page in which the term appeared in.</table><h4 id=markers-for-kanji-cards>Markers for Kanji Cards</h4><table class=table><thead class=thead-light><tr><th>Marker<th>Description<tbody><tr><td><code>{character}</code><td>Unicode glyph representing the current Kanji.<tr><td><code>{cloze-body}</code><td>Raw, inflected parent term as it appeared before being reduced to dictionary form by Yomichan.<tr><td><code>{cloze-prefix}</code><td>Text for the containing <code>{sentence}</code> from the start up to the value of <code>{cloze-body}</code>.<tr><td><code>{cloze-suffix}</code><td>Text for the containing <code>{sentence}</code> from the value of <code>{cloze-body}</code> to the end.<tr><td><code>{dictionary}</code><td>Name of the dictionary from which the card is being created.<tr><td><code>{glossary}</code><td>List of definitions for the Kanji.<tr><td><code>{kunyomi}</code><td>Kunyomi (Japanese reading) for the Kanji expressed as Katakana.<tr><td><code>{onyomi}</code><td>Onyomi (Chinese reading) for the Kanji expressed as Hiragana.<tr><td><code>{screenshot}</code><td>Screenshot of the web page taken at the time the Kanji was added.<tr><td><code>{sentence}</code><td>Sentence, quote, or phrase in which the character appears in the source content.<tr><td><code>{url}</code><td>Address of the web page in which the Kanji appeared in.</table></ol><p>When creating your model for Yomichan, <em>please make sure that you pick a unique field to be first</em>; fields that will
contain <code>{expression}</code> or <code>{character}</code> are ideal candidates for this. Anki does not require duplicate flashcards to be
added to a deck and uses the first field in the model to check for duplicates. If, for example, you have <code>{reading}</code>
configured to be the first field in your model and already have <ruby>橋<rt>はし</ruby> in your deck, you will not
be able to create a flashcard for <ruby>箸<rt>はし</ruby>, because they share the same reading.<h3 id=flashcard-creation>Flashcard Creation</h3><p>Once Yomichan is configured, it becomes trivial to create new flashcards with a single click. You will see the following

Although
everything “just works” in Chrome, depending on settings, Firefox users can run into problems due browser bugs.
Yomichan catches errors and tries to offer suggestions about how to work around Firefox issues, but in general at least
one of the following solutions should work for you:<ul><li>Make sure you have cookies enabled. It appears that disabling them also disables IndexedDB for some reason. You
can still have cookies be disabled on other sites; just make sure to add the Yomichan extension to the whitelist of
whatever tool you are using to restrict cookies. You can get the extension “URL” by looking at the address bar when
you have the search page open.<li>Make sure that you have sufficient disk space available on the drive Firefox uses to store your user profile.
Firefox limits the amount of space that can be used by IndexedDB to a small fraction of the disk space actually
available on your computer.<li>Make sure that you have history set to “Remember history” enabled in your privacy settings. When this option is
set to “Never remember history”, IndexedDB access is once again disabled for an inexplicable reason.<li>As a last resort, try using the <a href=https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/reset-preferences-fix-problems>Refresh Firefox</a>
feature to reset your user profile. It appears that the Firefox profile system can corrupt itself preventing
IndexedDB from being accessible to Yomichan.</ul><p><strong>Why does the Kanji results page display “No data found” for several fields?</strong><p>You are using data from the KANJIDIC dictionary that was exported for an earlier version of Yomichan. It does not
contain the additional information which newer versions of Yofomichan expect. Unfortunately, since major browser
implementations of IndexedDB do not provide reliable means for selective bulk data deletion, you will need purge
your database and install the latest version of the KANJIDIC to see additional information about characters.<p><strong>Can I still create cards without HTML formatting? The option for it is gone!</strong><p>Developing Yomichan is a constant balance between including useful features and keeping complexity at a minimum.
With the new user-editable card template system, it is possible to create text-only cards without having to double
the number field of templates in the extension itself. If you would like to stop HTML tags from being added to your
cards, simply copy the contents of the <a href=/projects/yomichan/dl/fields.txt>text-only field template</a> into the template box on
the Anki settings page (make sure you have the <em>Show advanced options</em> checkbox ticked), making sure to replace the
existing values.<p><strong>Will you add support for online dictionaries?</strong><p>Online dictionaries will never be implemented because it is impossible to support them in a robust way. In order to
perform Japanese deinflection, Yomichan must execute dozens of database queries per every single word. Factoring in
network latency and the fragility of web scraping, I do not believe that it is possible to realize a good user
experience.<p><strong>Is it possible to use Yomichan with files saved locally on my computer with Chrome?</strong><p>In order to use Yomichan with local files in Chrome, you must first tick the <em>Allow access to file URLs</em> checkbox
for Yomichan on the extensions page. Due to the restrictions placed on browser addons in the WebExtensions model, it
will likely never be possible to use Yomichan with PDF files.<p><strong>Is it possible to delete individual dictionaries without purging the database?</strong><p>Although it is technically possible to purge specific dictionaries, due to the limitations of the underlying browser
IndexedDB system, this process is <em>extremely</em> slow. For example, it can take up to ten minutes to delete a single
moderately-sized term dictionary! Instead of including a borderline unusable feature in Yomichan, I have chosen to
disable dictionary deletion entirely.<p><strong>Why aren&#39;t EPWING dictionaries bundled with Yomichan?</strong><p>The vast majority of EPWING dictionaries are proprietary, so unfortunately I am unable to legally include them in
this extension for copyright reasons.<p><strong>When are you going to add support for $MYLANGUAGE?</strong><p>Developing Yomichan requires a significant understanding of Japanese sentence structure and grammar. I have no time
